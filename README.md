# CampusRyde
## Save the World, Share a Ride!
The ride board web and Andriod application connecting to you to fellow students in an effort to reduce carbon emissions.

##Inspiration
In an effort to reduce our carbon footprint, we wanted to connect students together in a fun social way. Student drivers planning to drive home can post a trip to CampusRyde, and other students can tag-along, or find drivers headed in their intended direction.

## What we learned
We all challenged ourselves to expand our knowledge of web development. Most of us have not used Node.JS or Javascript before this weekend. 

## How we built it
We wanted to build a platform where university students traveling home can find other students traveling in their direction. We used Google Firebase, connected to a Heroku Node.js application. We also included Google's JavaScript Maps API and Geocoding API. We build the Andriod Application to mobilize our functionality.

## Challenges
API Integration,  learning JavaScript on the spot and setting up a hosting service for our application were our most dominant challenges.
